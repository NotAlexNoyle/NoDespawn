# NoDespawn-OG 2.1 Config.

# Should item despawning be completely disabled on player death?
disable-death-despawns: true

# How long should all other entities take to despawn? (in ticks).
# The vanilla behavior is 300 seconds, or 5 Minutes (roughly 6000 ticks).
# This will not impact non-death-pile entities until 3.0.
time-to-despawn: 6000

# If disable despawns is set to false, how long (in ticks) should items dropped on death last until despawn?
# Values range from 0 (instant despawn) to 32767 ticks (roughly 27 minutes).
# If higher than the max or lower than the min, defaults to the value of time-to-despawn above.
